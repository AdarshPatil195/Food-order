# Food-order
Algorithm to predict the person who likely to oder the food.
There has been a high demand for online food orders after the introduction of Swiggy and Zomato in the market. Food delivery companies use your buying habits to make the delivery process faster. Data about their customers that they now know the food ordering habits of all customers. With this data, they can also predict whether or not a customer will order again from their app. It is a good technique for identifying areas, families and customer types with more business opportunities.
The main objective of these companies toward their customers is to deliver the food at the right time. To deliver the food faster, these companies identify areas where the demand for online food orders is high and employ more delivery partners in those locations. It helps deliver food faster in areas with more orders.
Firstly imported the neccesary libraries need to compute the model such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, 
Imported the dataset from Kaggle which contents:
So the dataset contains information like:

    the age of the customer
    marital status of the customer
    occupation of the customer
    monthly income of the customer
    educational qualification of the customer
    family size of the customer
    latitude and longitude of the location of the customer
    pin code of the residence of the customer
    did the customer order again (Output)
    Feedback of the last order (Positive or Negative)
    
So based on above Dataset plotted the graph to konw features affecting the order pattern.
Further implemented Machine learning model ie: RandomForest classifier to predict food ordering pattern or whether the customer orders the food again through this app.

So this is how you can predict whether a customer will order food online again or not. The food order prediction system is one of the useful techniques food delivery companies can use to make the entire delivery process fast
